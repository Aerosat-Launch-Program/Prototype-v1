ISAT-8266 is first version of our prototype or satellite series **ISAT**. The purpose behind this prototype to create a foundation of ISAT, to understand
the complexity and working of satellite communication and data visualization.

ISAT-8266 is based on MCU- **ESP32** which was previously designed on **ESP8266**. The sensors installed are
- MPU6050 (GYROSCOPE, ACCELERATION)
- BMP180  (Pressure, Temperature, Altitude)

Other Electronics installed are for indication purposes..

Data communication is done over wifi, the ESP32 act as server.

# WORKING
> Power ISAT-8266
> When powered the will be one beep sound and green-red leds will start blinking. This indiactes the hardware is powered and all the sensor connections are successsfull.
> If indication are not as above, then do check the sensor connection properly.
> Next Connect with WIFI **ISAT_8266** from your system and open the software/GUI in the system
> It will automatically connect and start visualizing data.
> if not check the sensor connection and follow the indication.

Repository contains the first version of the I-SAT satellite wrapping the software and hardware details.
This prototype contains the basic detail about data commmunication and data visualization - integration of hardware and software.

Refer to the code and make necessary change if needed!!
