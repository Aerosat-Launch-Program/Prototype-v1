ISAT-8266 is first version of our prototype or satellite series **ISAT**. The purpose behind this prototype to create a foundation of ISAT, to understand
the complexity and working of satellite communication and data visualization.

ISAT-8266 is based on MCU- **ESP32** which was previously designed on **ESP8266**. The sensors installed are
- MPU6050 (GYROSCOPE, ACCELERATION)
- BMP180  (Pressure, Temperature, Altitude)

Other Electronics installed are for indication purposes..

Data communication is done over wifi, the ESP32 act as server.

Repository contains the first version of the I-SAT satellite wrapping the software and hardware details.
This prototype contains the basic detail about data commmunication and data visualization - integration of hardware and software.

Refer to the code and make necessary change if needed!!
